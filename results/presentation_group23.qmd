## Introduction/Background

Study(mailny investigating TMB), why was the study conducted?

we focus on Mutations here

## Materials

Dataset, some statistics(maily cancer type)

and Impact version

## Methods

-   Survival Analysis

-   Cox Regression

-   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

## Results

-   Surivival analysis(overall)

-   Number of Mutations & SV per Cancer Type

-   SV Analysis

    -   Kind of SVs+ Length

    -   Number of SVs per Gene-\>EGFR

    -   EGFR per Cancer Type -\> Glioma

    -   Overview Glioma

    -   Survival Correlation with Co-founders(especially gender)

    -   Survival analysis on gender(subset glioma)

    -   Gene SV+ Mutation from Glioma

    -   GSEA (SV) & Mutations

## Discussion

-   Study

    -   Tumor burden

    -   higher TMB-\> higher survival

    -   more mutations no indication of severity of cancer

    -   Glioma only exemption, here no correlation?
