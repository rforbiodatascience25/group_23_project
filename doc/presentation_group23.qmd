## Introduction/Background

Study(mailny investigating TMB), why was the study conducted?

Looking at different cancers, they wanted to look if a specific component of cancers, TMB, could affect the survival and the success rate of treatment with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), such as PD1, PDL1 and CTLA4.

we focus on Mutations here

## Materials

Dataset, some statistics(maily cancer type)

and Impact version

## Methods

-   Survival Analysis:
    -   package : 'survival'
    -   Surv(): function object, parameters: survival time + status (dead or alive) of each patient
    -   survfit(): fits the object to the Kaplan Meier estimator.
    -   data used: clinical_patients
    -   result: step curve, each step indicates the status of patients per unit time. It can be stratified to different parameters (sex, age, cancer..)
-   Cox Regression
-   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

## Results

-   Surivival analysis - stratified by Cancer type

-   Number of Mutations & SV per Cancer Type

-   SV Analysis

    -   Kind of SVs+ Length

    -   Number of SVs per Gene-\>EGFR

    -   EGFR per Cancer Type -\> Glioma

    -   Overview Glioma

    -   Survival Correlation with Co-founders(especially gender)

    -   Survival analysis on gender(subset glioma)

    -   Gene SV+ Mutation from Glioma

    -   GSEA (SV) & Mutations

## Discussion

-   Study

    -   Tumor burden

    -   higher TMB-\> higher survival

    -   more mutations no indication of severity of cancer

    -   Glioma only exemption, here no correlation?
